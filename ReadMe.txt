AssistedFreehand is used to get the mask, hold the left button to draw, and double click when completed

Functions:
1)In the first two blocks of code, we are reading the image and taking the user interactive mask.
2)Get-contour computes the contour where the bright pixels in the binary image with any of the 8-neighboring pixels as dark are considered in the contour
3)get_normal computes the normal on each point of contour by using the curve fitting method where we arrange the points in the clockwise direction and interpolated the intermediate values.
4)get_priorities computes the confidence and data values for each pixel on the contour and techniques used are discussed in the report.
5)get_max computes the index of the pixel having the maximum priority values.
6)get_sample and get_distance functions search the best matching exemplar.
7)update function updates the Image, binary image/mask, and confidence values
8)Check function checks whether the task is completed or not

Images:
Only Images have been taken from standard resources like GitHub, Google, and some generated images for our understanding.
